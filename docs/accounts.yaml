  Accounts are owned by entities and are used to exchange value. Each Account has an 
  Account Type. Each Account has a currency type. It's worth noting "currency" does not have 
  to mean government (or crypto) money. For example, Giving Credit recognizes a "social capital" 
  account which can be used to barter.
