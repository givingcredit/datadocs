  Funds are how partner organizations capitalize social credit networks on Giving Credit. 
  Each Fund is operated by a Partner Organization and has a distinct Fund Type. For example, one 
  fund might provide loan guarantees while another fund might provide cash transfers.

    description: > 
      Each fund can have any number of members. Members are users on the platform who have a relationship with 
      the fund. A fund membership does not mean the member receives a benefit from the 
      fund (such as a loan guarantee), but one cannot receive a benefit from the fund 
      without being a fund member. The FundMember object has a Constituent. 
      The logic here is that a person is a Constituent of an Organization 
      and uses various Funds via Fund Membership.
