title: Entities
description: Entities are generic objects that represent every person, organization, etc. on the platform. Entities are the backbone of the social credit network. Because people and organizations are both represented as entities, this allows Giving Credit to treat people and organizations equally. For example, just as people can give credit to each other, so too can organizations. This is all made possible by the entity model.
